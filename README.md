# Tensorflow-Food
This repository contains four Jupyter notebooks that showcase different techniques for building and training TensorFlow models. The notebooks cover techniques such as scaling up, transfer learning, fine-tuning, and combining them all together.

#Notebooks
- Scaling Up.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to scale up a TensorFlow model using a small data set before scaling up to a larget dataset.

- Transfer Learning.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to use transfer learning to build a custom image classifier. It shows how to take a pre-trained model such as EfficentNet, remove the top layers, and add new layers on top that are specific to your dataset.

- Fine Tuning.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained model to improve its performance on a specific task. It shows how to take a pre-trained model such as EfficentNet unfreeze some of its layers, and retrain the model on a new dataset.

- DeepFood.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to combine the techniques from the previous notebooks to build a custom image classifier that is both accurate and efficient. It shows how to use transfer learning and fine-tuning to build a custom model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a specific task.

Requirements
To run these notebooks, you will need to install TensorFlow 2.0 or later, as well as the following packages:

- numpy
- matplotlib

#Usage
To use these notebooks, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the desired notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Follow the instructions in each notebook to train and evaluate the TensorFlow model.
